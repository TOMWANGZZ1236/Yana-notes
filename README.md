## Lessons Learned and Journey

### Challenges Faced
- **Integration of Firebase**: One of the initial challenges was integrating Firebase with Flutter. Managing user authentication and data storage efficiently required deep understanding of asynchronous operations in Dart.
- **Release on App Store**: Another challenge is to get all the permissions and developer certificates to let me release this app on App Store.

### Accomplishments
- **Robust Authentication**: Developing a secure and robust authentication system using Firebase Auth helped in protecting user data.

### What I Learned
This project not only bolstered my technical skills in Flutter and Firebase but also improved my understanding of full-stack mobile development. I also learned the importance of persistence and iterative development in software engineering.
